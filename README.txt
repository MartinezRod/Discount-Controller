This program is for a Discount Calculator that allows the user to input the original price, 
a value for how much dollars they will remove from that price, any discounts, and the tax, and in
return it shows the new discounted price. It also lets you move between two different views by swiping left or right.

Unfortunately, I was unable to finish as I kept getting "Nan" as my values on the second window.
